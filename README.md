# Communion Community

## About Communion
`A place to help others and to get help from others!`

Communion community is providing a platform for developers to learn, interact, share ideas, support each other and grow.If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a Communion community. There are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support, sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more.
